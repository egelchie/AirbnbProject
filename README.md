Traveling in Europe can be an exciting but expensive experience, especially for students on a tight budget. One of the most challenging aspects of planning a trip is finding affordable and comfortable accommodation. Choosing between a hostel, hotel, or Airbnb can be a difficult decision, with many factors to consider. The risks associated with selecting an Airbnb listing can be particularly daunting, as travelers often do not know what to expect until they arrive at the property. To help travelers make informed decisions, we have analyzed a dataset of Airbnb listings in European cities to explore the factors that contribute to customer satisfaction and pricing. Our machine learning model predicts customer satisfaction ratings based on the features of the listing, providing valuable insights for both hosts and travelers on the Airbnb platform. By breaking down the main factors of Airbnb pricing across European cities, we aim to help travelers find affordable and comfortable accommodations without the risk of ending up sleeping on a straw mattress in a dank basement.
